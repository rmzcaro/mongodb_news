Whenever a user visits the site, the app should scrape stories from a news outlet of choice and display them for the user. Each scraped article should be saved to the application database. At a minimum, the app scrapes and displays the following information for each article:

Headline - the title of the article

Summary - a short summary of the article

URL - the url to the original article

Users can leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users are able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments are visible to every user.
