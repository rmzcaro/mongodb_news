Tech Crunch Scraper: 

Users can see a list of articles from techcrunch.com including the headline, summary, image and url of the article. Users can also add and delete comments on each article. The comments are saved in the mongo database so users can revisit them later. 

This app is useful for users who are interested in solely the news content and want to keep notes about each article. This app gets rid of extra fluff. 

To get started, just go to the website and the list of articles will render along with previously added comments. 

This app is maintained by Caro.
